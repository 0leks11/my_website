        <p>Hi there! I’m Oleksii Kozyrev, a passionate front-end development student with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a beginner, I’m dedicated to building responsive and visually appealing websites that meet modern web standards. My focus is on clean code, attention to detail, and delivering projects on time.
            Even though I’m at the start of my career, I’m eager to take on projects that allow me to grow while providing value to clients. Whether it’s a simple landing page or a more complex feature, I’m here to help bring your vision to life with high-quality front-end solutions.
            I am continuously improving my skills, and I’m excited to collaborate with clients who are open to working with a developer who is driven, hardworking, and eager to learn. Let’s work together to turn your ideas into reality.</p>

            <h3>Suggested Hourly Rate:</h3>
            <p>As a junior developer starting out on Upwork, it’s common to set a competitive rate. Since you’re still learning and building experience, you could start at around $10-15 per hour. This is a good range to attract clients while you build up your portfolio and get some initial projects under your belt. As you gain more experience and positive reviews, you can gradually increase your rate.</p>
