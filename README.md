My Personal Website

This is my personal website, created and deployed in just one day. It showcases my capabilities as a front-end developer and serves as a live example of what I can build for you. Feel free to explore the functionality of this site, and imagine the possibilities for your own project. Iâ€™m ready to create unique websites tailored to your needs.

Project Overview

I created a dynamic single-page website that showcases my front-end development skills. The project involved several key steps:

	1.	HTML Development: I began by structuring the website using HTML, ensuring a clear layout and semantic organization of content.
	2.	CSS Styling: Next, I designed the visual appearance of the site with CSS, incorporating responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing across devices.
	3.	JavaScript Interactivity: To enhance user experience, I added interactive elements using JavaScript, including functional buttons that respond to user actions.
	4.	Docker Containerization: I then encapsulated the entire project within a Docker container, allowing for consistent deployment and easy management of the application environment.
	5.	GitHub Repository: The project was pushed to a GitHub repository for version control and collaboration, ensuring that all changes are tracked and documented.
	6.	Server Deployment: Finally, I deployed the containerized application to a server, making it accessible online for users to explore.
